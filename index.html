          <p>
            As I said, my name is <strong><i>Wassim Krim</i></strong
            >, a university student majoring in Computer Science, moving into my
            second year. This year I will be the top of my class (I'm not
            kidding this time). Anyway, I'm currently planning to go to study in
            Algiers to develop my skills a bit, and also to have more
            opportunities to achieve my goal. If I can't go to study in Algiers,
            that's normal, but it will affect me a bit negatively. Anyway, I
            have a goal that extends from <b>2025 to 2030</b>, which is to
            <b>marry Princess Leonor of Spain</b>. To achieve that, I must work.
            And when I say work, it's not just any work. This time, I mean a
            princess, meaning I must work hard. Imagine the amount of work that
            awaits me, but I haven't given up.
          </p>

        <h2>Do you know why?</h2>
        <div class="text">
      <p>
              Of course not. This is because I am a person who, if he sets his
              mind to something, will achieve it, no matter what that goal is,
              even if it is conquering the world. Okay, back to the goal.
      </p>
      </div>
           
        <h2>Why Leonor exactly?</h2>

      <h2>why?</h2>
      <div class="text">
     
        <p>
          Leonor is the most suitable person for me in every way. When I thought
          about her in my head, I said to myself, why was I wasting away like an
          idiot? When I first saw her on the phone, when a rumor spread that she
          liked a football player, and it was a false rumor, I felt something
          strange towards her, an incomprehensible feeling, but it attracted me
          more and more, and I was trying to understand that feeling until April
          2025. On Saturday, I woke up happy, as if something had returned to
          its path and that the path this time had become clear, not as usual.
          Then I sat with myself for a while and asked myself what I want.
          <b>Then the soul said: ????</b> Then
          <b>
            said: But you must have a partner with you, someone who has the same
            way of thinking as you, the same desires as you, the same mentality
            to achieve this goal</b>
           <b>
            The soul said: Spain is ruled by a king, right? And since he is a
            king, there is an heir to the throne. If it is a boy, try to become
            close to him and share your thoughts with him. And if it is a girl,
            the same thing, but instead of getting close, marry her</b>
          
          So <b>I said in my head</b>, wait a moment. I know that there is a
          Spanish princess named Leonor, and there I understood that feeling
          that I felt the first time I saw her. There I knew that something
          abnormal was happening. Then I was drawn to her. I liked the way she
          spoke, her elegance, her steadfastness, her intelligence. I liked
          every detail about her. Then I told my friends about this, as I hoped
          that they would understand what I felt, but I met disappointing
          answers (impossible, you cannot do it. She is a princess and you are a
          normal person, and laughter in amazement at what I said, and much,
          much more). At this moment I knew that something abnormal was
          happening, as if fate was telling me to hurry. I am excited to see
          that in the future, and I am in that The moment I realized who I am
          and who I am. Many questions were answered at that moment. Then I
          realized that I must complete the road alone, but I wanted to find a
          competitor or a friend with me on the road. Then I went to the Reddit
          application and published my goal, which is to marry the Spanish
          Princess Leonor in five years. There were many positive comments and a
          few stupid comments. The goal was to search for someone who has a
          similar or greater goal, but unfortunately I did not find anyone. It
          was as if something was telling me this is your path and your goal.
          After that, I put a solid plan to develop myself over a period of
          years, but the matter was not easy at all. But I was doing what I
          could to reach my goal, and that if I wanted something, I was the one
          who must reach it and take it. After that, I was thinking and thinking
          and thinking and thinking until my head became a collection of endless
          plans. But there was a dark side, which is the devil. He tried to keep
          me away from the goal many times, but he could not. I entered into
          many wars with him. One day he wins and one day I win, and I continued
          the situation until I reached a series Great victories and there was
          their king, the devil of anger, he was the first king I brought down
          after that I brought down the king of lust and others who were trying
          to delay me from my goal and after a few days I decided to go to
          Algiers to develop myself and make some relationships maybe I will
          find people who have the same thinking as me but unfortunately I did
          not find people who have the same thinking as me but they are
          interested in my goal and gave their attention remember that I do not
          speak from a vacuum after that I started thinking in a crazy way then
          I got up and said this world wants to delay me from my goal and the
          filth wants me to reach it anyway I prepared a strong system learning
          the Spanish language resistance exercises running daily and pushing my
          limits and healthy eating and taking care of myself and the body I was
          disciplined and working hard but as I said the world wants to delay me
          so what happened happened and I did not follow the plan I made for a
          whole week but I promised myself and fate and Leonor that the return
          will be stronger but before that I saw a feeling that Leonor had
          slipped from my hand but I was wrong it was a
          <em>stupid devil who wanted Keep me away from the goal</em>, but I
          swear that I will continue no matter what happens, even if the world
          is against me, they say that this is impossible, I am with you, the
          one who created the world and the one who created the impossible. And
          in the end, I want to say something to my future self. Where have you
          reached? I know that you are going through difficult times, but you
          are close. Remember yourself when you were working hard in the
          beginning. You should not stop now. Continue and tell the world that
          you are here, and tell Leonor that you have come to take her, not as a
          princess, but as a woman who understands what I want, my future self.
          I think that when you read this, you will be going to give a speech to
          the world. As for Leonor, now I want to say to everyone who reads
          this, I will not disappoint you, and you will see what the world has
          not seen. Just put your trust in me.

        Well, how do you convince a blind person that the moon is beautiful
        today? Honestly, if I were the same person before this goal appeared, I
        would have told myself that this is impossible, but in fact, I was
        looking for something bigger, and now I am on my way to it. Since I am
        dead, dead, I will die happy, and I have left an impact on this world.
        After I set the goal, which is to marry Princess Leonor, I began to see
        people as stupid. I look at them and say that they are wasting their
        time in emptiness, and there I realized that I have been cured of
        blindness, and people are still blind and do not see.
